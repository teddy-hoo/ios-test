In July of this year I found out I was pregnant with my first child. 6 days later I was hospitalized for an ectopic pregnancy. I needed emergency surgery to remove the ectopic and was told that my right Fallopian tube was abnormal and my chances of fertility would be lessened by it. \nWe are now trying to conceive again. \n\nYou see the most frustrating part in all this is that I donated my eggs several years ago to couples who wanted to have children. I never thought I would find anyone to have children with. Now that I have found my Prince Charming, these difficulties have occurred. \n\nI am glad to be here, connecting with others who are trying to conceive. \n",

I was on CD 31 today, cramping, etc. POAS and got a BFN, then after church I ended up spotting, so I'm assuming I started and will try again next month. I feel like I don't know when anything is going on in my cycle, so it's time to get serious about charting. I am glad to meet y'all and hope we can all support each other along on our journeys. :)",

I just needed to have that big let out of feelings. I also lost 10lbs. the month after I was able to conceive. I'm not saying to relax and/or quit cause you can't quit something you want so desperately. just maybe have a really good vent and cry with a trusted friend. :) you will feel better emotionally and you will cleanse your body of tensions and stresses. :) I hope it helps.",
